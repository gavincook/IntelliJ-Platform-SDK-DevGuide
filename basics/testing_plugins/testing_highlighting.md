title: Testing Highlighting
---

A common task when writing plugin tests is testing various kinds of highlighting (inspections, annotators, parser error highlighting etc.) The *IntelliJ Platform* provides a dedicated utility and markup format for this task.

To test the highlighting for the file currently loaded into the in-memory editor, you invoke the `checkHighlighting()` method. The parameters to the method specify which severities should be taken into account when comparing the results with the expected results: errors are always taken into account, whereas warnings, weak warnings and infos are optional. Alternatively, you can use the `testHighlighting()` method, which loads a `testdata` file into the in-memory editor and highlights it as a single operation.

If you need to test inspections (rather than generic highlighting provided by a highlighting lexer or annotator), you need to enable inspections that you're testing. This is done by calling `CodeInsightTestFixture.enableInspections()` in the setup method of your test or directly in a test method, before the call to `checkHighlighting()`.

The expected results of the highlighting are specified directly in the source file. The platform supports an extensive XML-like markup language for this. In its simplest form, the markup looks like this:

```xml
<warning descr="expected error message">code to be highlighted</warning>
```

Or, as a more specific example:

```xml
public int <warning descr="The compareTo() method does not reference 'foo' which is referenced from equals(); inconsistency may result">compareTo</warning>(Simple other) {
    return 0;
}
```

The tag name specifies the severity of the expected highlighting. The following severities are supported:

* `<error>`
* `<warning>`
* `<weak_warning>`
* `<info>`
* `<inject>` (for an injected fragment)
* `<symbolName>` (for a marker that highlights an identifier according to its type)
* any custom severity can be referenced by its name

The tag can also have the following optional attributes:

* `descr` - expected message associated with the highlighter (if not specified, any text will match; if the message contains a quotation mark, it can be escaped by putting two backslash characters before it)
* `foregroundColor`, `backgroundColor`, `effectColor` expected colors for the highlighting
* `effectType` expected effect type for the highlighting (see `EffectType` enum for possible values)
* `fontType` expected font style for the highlighting (0 - normal, 1 - bold, 2 - italic, 3 - bold italic)
