title: IntelliJ Action System
---

This tutorial is meant to give general information about the IntelliJ Platform Action System and lead you through a series of steps
which show how to create, register, and customize custom actions and action groups.
Action system provides an option to handle certain events in a desired way. 
Action can either be simply a response to some state, or be bound to UI element and could be invoked on demand. 
These UI elements include main menu, context menus, and toolbars.
