In this tutorial you will learn how to write and run automated tests for your plugin.

As an example we will take the plugin implemented in the [Custom Language Support](/tutorials/custom_language_support_tutorial.md) and cover its code with functional tests.

*  [1. Tests Prerequisites](writing_tests_for_plugins/tests_prerequisites.md)
*  [2. Parsing Test](writing_tests_for_plugins/parsing_test.md)
*  [3. Completion Test](writing_tests_for_plugins/completion_test.md)
*  [4. Annotator Test](writing_tests_for_plugins/annotator_test.md)
*  [5. Formatter Test](writing_tests_for_plugins/formatter_test.md)
*  [6. Rename Test](writing_tests_for_plugins/rename_test.md)
*  [7. Folding Test](writing_tests_for_plugins/folding_test.md)
*  [8. Find Usages Test](writing_tests_for_plugins/find_usages_test.md)
*  [9. Commenter Test](writing_tests_for_plugins/commenter_test.md)
*  [10. Reference Test](writing_tests_for_plugins/reference_test.md)
